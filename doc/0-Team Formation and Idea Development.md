## 📌 **IDEA EVALUATION & PRIORITIZATION TABLE**

**MVP (P0)🔴** These are the **essential features** required to make the application functional.

**Important (P1)🟡** These features are important for **enhancing the user experience**, but they are not critical

**Optional (P2)🟣** These are **secondary features** that can be added **after the initial launch**. They are useful, but not necessary

**Future (P3)🔵** These features are for the **long-term roadmap** and should be integrated after the app has gained traction and other higher priority features have been completed
