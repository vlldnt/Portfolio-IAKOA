## Firebase SDK
**As I‚Äôm building my app with SwiftUI and Firebase, I‚Äôve chosen to use the Firebase SDK directly. Below is a comparison between the REST API endpoints and the corresponding Firebase SDK methods I‚Äôll be using in the project.**
### üë§ USERS

| Action              | REST API Endpoint                           | Firebase SDK (Swift)                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create user         | POST `/api/users`                           | `Auth.auth().createUser(...)` + `Firestore().collection("users").addDocument(...)`   |
| Get user by ID      | GET `/api/users/{id}`                       | `Firestore().collection("users").document(id).getDocument(...)`                      |

| Remove favorite     | DELETE `/api/users/{id}/favorites/{eventId}`| `Firestore().collection("users").document(id).collection("favorites").document(eventId).delete(...)` |

### üßë‚Äçüé® CREATORS

### List of external APIs:
- **CoreLocation:** Apple framework for obtaining the geographical position of the device
- **MapKit:** Apple framework for displaying and interacting with maps
- **Sirene:** Unique identification number for businesses in France (SIREN)
- **Image/PDF Analysis API**: API for analyzing and extracting information from images and PDFs (ex: Google Cloud Vision / PDF.co)

## Plan Software Configuration Management and Quality Assurance Strategies

### SCM Strategy
1. Version Control Tool:
  - **Tool**: Git
  - **Purpose**: To manage code versions, track changes, and facilitate collaboration among developers.

2. Branching Strategies:
  - **main** ‚Äî for the functional project (stable, production-ready)
  - **dev** ‚Äî for improvements (integration and development of new features)
  - **test** ‚Äî for testing (quality assurance, validation)

3. Commit and Code Review Process:
- **Regular Commits:** commit changes regularly with meaningful commit messages

### QA Strategy
### 1. Testing Strategy:

  - **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions and methods to ensure they work as expected
  - **Integration Tests:** 
    - Verify the interaction between your SwiftUI views and Firebase services (authentication, database reads/writes).
    - Use tools like XCTest with mock Firebase services or use Firebase emulators to simulate backend responses.
  - **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing for critical user flows and edge cases
### 2. Testing Tools:
  - Unit Tests: XCTest (for SwiftUI)
  - Manual Testing
