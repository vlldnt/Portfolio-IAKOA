# IAKOA - MVP Development and Execution

## üóìÔ∏è Plan and Define Sprints

### Week 1: Initial Setup & Authentication Features

- Set up the project structure (SwiftUI + Firebase)
- Implement user and creator account creation (signup)
- Add login/logout functionalities using Firebase Authentication
- Set up basic Firestore database structure:
  - `users`, `creators`, `events` collections
- Begin testing authentication flows (manually or with XCTest)

---

### Week 2: First Front-End Mockup and UI Integration

- Design and implement basic UI screens using SwiftUI:
  - Login screen
  - Registration screen
  - Home screen layout
- Create placeholders for:
  - Event list
  - Event detail views
- Connect UI with authentication backend (real-time login/signup)
- Enable navigation between main views (login ‚Üí home, etc.)
- Begin user testing with minimal design to validate flows

---

### Week 3: Fetching Events & UI/UX Enhancements

- Implement functionality to fetch events from Firestore
- Display event list with:
  - Location
  - Date
  - Title
- Improve UI/UX:
  - Spacing and visual hierarchy
  - Responsive layout
- Add user-specific features:
  - Add events to favorites
  - View/edit user profile
- Add loading indicators and error messages

---

### Week 4: Filters, Map View, and Main APIs Integration

- Implement filters for events:
  - By category
  - By location
- Integrate **CoreLocation** for detecting user‚Äôs location
- Use **MapKit** to display events on a map
- Connect to external APIs:
  - **Sirene API** for SIREN/SIRET validation
  - Optional: other APIs for enhanced features (e.g., maps)
- Finalize MVP features:
  - User/creator interactions
  - Event discovery and saving
- Test full user journey end-to-end

## 2. Monitor Progress and Adjust

Since I was working alone, I managed my project by myself

- I tracked my progress by committing and pushing working functionalities regularly to GitHub

- I've mainly code on another repository : ***[iakoa-app](https://github.com/vlldnt/iakoa-app)*** for the commits list

- After completing each feature or fixing a bug, I made sure to document the changes and update the project status
- I reviewed my work frequently to identify any issues or areas needing improvement.
- When I encountered blockers or challenges, I adjusted my approach to stay on schedule.
- Although there were no daily stand-ups, I kept a personal log of progress and planned the next tasks accordingly

## Final Integration and QA Testing Summary
After implementing each functionality, I thoroughly tested it individually to ensure it worked as expected. Once multiple features were integrated, I performed extensive testing and various manipulations to verify that all components worked smoothly together without breaking each other

During this phase, I encountered several issues where modifying one function affected other parts of the app‚Äî for example, the map filter used both in event details and the main map view caused conflicts

These experiences helped me identify dependencies and improve the overall integration to maintain stability and seamless user experience
