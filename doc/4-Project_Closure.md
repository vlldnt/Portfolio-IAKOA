# Project Closure Summary – Solo Developer

## Results Summary

As a solo developer, I successfully built a functional MVP that meets most of the project’s original goals, including:

- Event discovery based on location or keywords with support for 70 categories  
- Browsing events without requiring user login  
- Automatic detection and use of the user’s location for relevant suggestions  
- User account creation with personalized features  
- Creator accounts with event hosting and management capabilities  
- GDPR-compliant data handling, including user consent, privacy policy, and data deletion
- Event creation restricted to logged-in, verified creators  
- Use of native iOS technologies (Swift, SwiftUI) and backend services (Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore)  
- Integration of device features like camera and geolocation  
- A simple, intuitive UI with filters, favorites, and smooth navigation  

Approximately 95% of the planned features were completed and manually tested, with positive feedback on usability and performance.  
The integration with the SIRENE API for creator verification was not achieved despite multiple attempts.


## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well  
- Effective task management and organization allowed steady progress despite working alone.  
- Communication with mentors and stakeholders helped maintain focus and gather valuable feedback.  
- Leveraging collaboration tools like GitHub supported version control and project tracking.

### Challenges  
- External API integration (SIRENE) posed technical challenges that couldn’t be fully resolved.  
- Initial time estimates for testing were optimistic; more time was required near the project’s end.

### Improvements for Future Projects  
- Plan more buffer time for testing and bug fixing phases.  
- Create clearer task plans and success criteria from the start.  
- Incorporate regular self-review or seek external code reviews to improve quality even when working solo.
